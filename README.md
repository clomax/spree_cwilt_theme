Theme for the Cwilt shop [shop.cwilt.co.uk].

Installation
------------

Add spree_cwilt_theme to your Gemfile:

```ruby

```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_cwilt_theme:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:
